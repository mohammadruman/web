So, first of all, thank you very much for having me here at the Inspire Series.
0:16
It’s worked dramatically, I’m already inspired to be addressing this really August
0:21
intellectual gathering of people from Harvard, a place that my mother thought I will never
0:26
reach.
0:27
But you know what, lot of people have spoken before me and eloquently and described their
0:33
dreams for India and given figures and facts that either are skeptical and like, Mr. Omar
0:40
says, aspirational.
0:41
But I’m just an actor and I’m going to just give you my dream shamelessly, because
0:47
that’s the thing that I can do best.
0:50
And by that, I mean when we talk of dreams we have one of our greatest scientists and
0:56
philanthropists Dr. Abdul Kalam, and he said something which is very interesting.
1:01
He said, “Dreams are not what you have when you sleep.
1:05
The true dreams are the ones that don’t let you sleep”.
1:11
He said, “When you have that dream once it’s a dream; when you have it twice it
1:15
becomes a desire.
1:17
And when you see it for the third time consecutively, it becomes a passion, an aim and a goal”,
1:21
and that is the passion with which I want to see this fantasy that I have for India
1:26
2030.
1:28
And Abraham Lincoln also was a dreamer and you know, but he said one thing that makes
1:35
most sense in trying to achieve this goal that I have dreamed for my nation.
1:39
He said, “If I have six hours to cut down a tree, then I would spend the first four
1:45
hours sharpening the axe.”
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

1:48
There’s a great philosophy in that.
1:49
In this era of instant gratification we just keep thinking we can achieve all these goals
1:54
by just tweaking this, tweaking that, it’s not true.
1:56
I really believe that a missionary zeal is required to make that quantum change, that
2:02
can make 2030 of what I’m dreaming about right now.
2:05
And just let’s look at India as a country, what a unique nation!
2:10
Seriously.
2:11
Thousands of years old of culture and tradition, many many invasions, being ruled for many
2:18
years and we still somehow managed to maintain our identity.
2:22
We still somehow have managed to maintain our Indian-ness — our beliefs, our faith
2:29
and you know, yeah, there has been — we have our drawbacks — there is corruption,
2:34
there is violence, there is differences between the different religions and sects and caste
2:39
and everything.
2:40
But I can’t help but think looking at India at the geography that we’re not doing really
2:47
that bad.
2:49
Look at all the other nations around in the world.
2:51
Look at our neighbors, compared to that there is somebody in India who’s doing something
2:56
right for us to be called a growing economy and being projected as the third largest economy
3:02
in 2026 and the most educated and young nation in the world, it’s still functional democracy.
3:08
So let’s first accept the fact that there is somebody, some people in India with the
3:14
right ideas and the ability to lead the nation to where we are today.
3:19
Under that assumption — under that assumption we are also very capable of finding very unique
3:25
solutions to the problems that generally the world faces.
3:29
And one of them, of course, is the fact that we found freedom through non-violence and
3:35
non-cooperation; who would’ve thought that was possible?
3:38
We have some other – no, seriously I mean it was as radical of thought then as it is
3:44
today, and one man in a loincloth would believe in faith and complete conviction was able
3:50
to do that for us — you know, Mahatma Gandhi, and it’s an amazing country of people like
3:56
Mahavir, Gautam Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi and then Bhagat Singh who also had a dream.
4:03
He dreamed then 85 years ago, that I dream of an India where no infant cries for the
4:09
want of milk, no youngster is deprived of relevant education, and no youth goes door
4:18
to door finding a job.
4:20
Sadly, it’s still a dream today.
4:23
And I dream of a 2030 when this dream becomes irrelevant.
4:27
I dream of a 2030 when everybody is so equally satisfied with what they’re doing, that
4:32
they’re able to actually devote about more time back to art and culture which is another
4:35
great important aspect of our country.
4:38
Now we need to be – for that to happen we need to be a healthy nation.
4:43
And when I say healthy, I remember preparing for a film of mine which was released recently
4:48
where I had to look like a boxer and I had this biceps and triceps that had to be there.
4:53
So I decided just to work on the parts that is seen outside my clothes.
4:59
So I was just working out of my biceps and my triceps and my shoulders but you know what
5:02
I suddenly realized, the strengths that I had in my arms and biceps was not actually
5:07
enough for me to look even fit because it is disproportionate growth.
5:11
It is the kind of growth that will not make you fit or strong but actually make you look
5:16
inadequate.
5:18
And that is what is happening to India today.
5:21
Everybody says we are the largest economy — we’re going to be the most populated
5:24
country in the years to come and you know with economic superpower and supremacy in
5:30
rocket and space technology which I am privy to and then the IT giants and smarter cities.
5:36
But ladies and gentlemen, I really believe that more than smarter cities we require smart
5:43


villages.
5:47
And this is going to be primarily what I talk about today.
5:49
You know, a nation is only as strong as its weakest link and rural India is our weakest
5:55
link.
5:56
See, it’s important that growth and progress goes hand-in-hand with villages also getting
6:04
onto the same train towards economic freedom, super-powerdom, all terms that has been coined
6:10
for a successful country but that is not happening, the reason being we’re beginning to ignore
6:18
them, we’re beginning to actually believe that —
6:22
This is a very interesting line that I have found, where they say that everybody believes
6:28
that they know what is required for getting the underprivileged and the poor up to speed
6:34
with the rest of the country.
6:35
OK, and we always start assuming that this is what they want; this is how we can help
6:42
the poor and the villages and this is what they need.
6:44
And we can’t be more wrong, because when you assume, and as the spelling goes you make
6:49
an ass of you and me, let me tell you how that happened to a friend of mine.
6:53
His name was — he’s a very profound doctor, a gastroenterologist, and he got a call from
6:59
his patient Mr. Abdul, who said, “Doctor Saab, my wife is really really ill and she’s
7:04
got a big stomach ache and she can’t sit and she can’t sleep and she’s in big pain,
7:10
can I come and visit you?”
7:11
And he said, ‘Yes, by all means’.
7:12
And like all patients today he’s done his research, he’s gone into the internet and
7:16
he said, “usko yeh ho sakta hain, wo sakta hain, and the doctor said, ‘Don’t worry
7:19
let me handle it’.
7:21
And he checked her out and he said “She has an infected appendix, so I have to do
7:25
a surgery and she’ll be fine.”
7:27
The surgery was done, she was fine and Abdul was a happy man.
7:32
One year later, he calls back to doctor and says, “Sir, my wife has got a stomach ache,
7:39
please do the appendix operation, she’ll be fine.”
7:40
And so doctor said — the doctor Manu said, “Listen, I am the doctor, let me diagnose,
7:47
Abdul, please bring her to the clinic and we’ll fix it up.”
7:50
But he said, ‘No, no, sir fix up that operation date, we’ll do it in half an hour and we’ll
7:54
be back — just she needs that appendix removed’.
7:57
So now he’s losing his patience, he says “Let me do the diagnosis, Abdul, bring her
8:01
to the clinic.”
8:02
And he’s still insisting and finally the doctor lost it, and he said, “Listen, I
8:06
am the doctor and let me tell you that every human being has only one appendix, and I have
8:11
already taken out the appendix.
8:13
So please don’t tell me how to do my job.”
8:15
Abdul waited very patiently for the doctor to finish with his assumptions and then he
8:20
shot back very meekly, he says, “Sir, I agree with you, every human being can have
8:25
one appendix but a man can have two wives, right?”
8:36
So when we start assuming what the rural India needs, we do what I think is most dangerous.
8:44
In my vast experiences of shooting in really rural India’s, and villages and small [cook-gramins]
8:50
like they call it in Tamil, really small places, I realized shockingly that the biggest financial
8:57
burden for a person of this particular village, would you all be able to guess what his biggest
9:02
financial burden is — five minutes!
9:04
Hey so I’m going to speak for 20 today, I am going to reduce the number of questions,
9:07
I’m prepared, is that OK?
9:09
OK, so can you all tell me, anybody, quick answers — anybody know which is the biggest
9:13
financial burden for a man in one of these small villages?
9:17
Sorry, tap, health, OK.
9:23
Not health, not the marriage of a daughter, not education, not – liquor, thank you for
9:31
reminding me, no.
9:34
Say it again, dowry, no, no, no, no.
9:40
Let me put you out of your misery.
9:43
I’m saying why does he need financial assistance for — the answer is the untimely death of
9:52
one relative of a senior in their family, that is the one occasion he can’t prepare
9:57
for, that is one occasion where the ceremony demands that he spend a certain amount of
10:02
money, feed a certain amount of people, use the funeral expenditures and that’s where
10:08
he takes the loan and that’s where he gets indebted and that’s where, to escape that
10:13
particular embarrassment and humility of not having the ability to perform the function
10:17
every year as a specter of the Indian tradition that he decides to leave the village, because
10:22
he’s made to feel inadequate.
10:24
Lord Macaulay in 1735 had spoken in the British Parliament and said, “The only way to rule
10:32
India is to make the men there feel inadequate”, he said and truly so, that unless he feels
10:39
that what he has is lesser than what others have, you will not be able to rule him.
10:45
And within a very short period they proved themselves right.
10:48
The rural India today is feeling inadequate, they are feeling like they’re not even part
10:53
of our country.
10:55
And what happens with that is they start then looking at opportunities in villages and saying
11:00
better education, better health, better lifestyle and no humility for not having performed the
11:04
funeral properly, they decide to give up who they are and move to the cities.
11:10
And who they are is what is more important for us to understand.
11:14
Who they are, are actually the timekeepers and the bookkeepers of our deep-rooted traditional
11:19
culture and stories.
11:22
You know, you should see how tradition and culture flourishes in a happy village in India.
11:29
We don’t have psychiatrist as a big fashion thing in India and they still manage to maintain
11:36
a great level of sanity.
11:38
You know, there’s a great phrase from the poem, ‘If’ by Rudyard Kipling where it
11:44
says, ‘Dream but not make dreams your master; think but not make thoughts your aim; meet
11:50
with triumph and disaster and treat those two Impostors just the same.’
11:54
It’s very easy to say it but how do you treat those two Impostors just the same?
11:57
The answer lies in the tradition and the culture and the books and the epics that are so prominent
12:03
and predominant in our country – The Bhagavad Gita, the Koran, the interpretation of that
12:08
in the subcontinent, the Bible, the Guru Granth Sahib, the Granny stories, and you know how
12:14
to handle the diversities and the setbacks and you’re able to sit back, assemble — reassemble
12:19
yourself, come back and fight with the same glory again.
12:23
And we don’t give him — when you don’t give a villager that, you’re depriving him,
12:28
we’re depriving ourselves of what I think is one of the most important survival tools
12:32
in today’s world, which is the culture and tradition.
12:35
So I dream of a 2030 where rural India is as developed as the rest of the world, is
12:40
as aspirational as the rest of India and where the villager is providedg with the same opportunities
12:48
as it is available in the cities.
12:49
And after a hard day’s work, a villager is actually able to come back, sit down, have
12:53
a drink, put his feet up and start thinking about art and culture and poetry.
12:56
That would be a dream that I have for 2030 — a practical dream that I have for 2030.
13:05
And the dreams that your parents and my parents had when we were in college — urban middle
13:11
class – where everything revolved around the boy, studying hard, getting into a technical
13:16
college of a repute and then getting into a reputed managements college and finally
13:21
the green card.
13:24
And if it was the girl, then it was a spouse with a green card.
13:29
I dream of a 2030 where students the world over will dream of a blue card, will dream
13:35
of having once actually come to India and study and imbibe the knowledge that we have
13:41
as a nation.
13:42
It used to be true: we were the first university in the world – Nalanda was the university
13:46
where people came in from far and wide.
13:49
So it’s not a pipe dream, it’s a practical dream that I have, and I think that’s easily,
13:55
easily attainable.
13:56
And finally, before I wind up, I think, I’ll dream of a 2030 where we have a meritocratic
14:04
electoral base which selects its leaders and whose leaders believe that it is more important
14:11
to serve — with a missionary zeal to serve the nation rather than rule it.
14:18
You know, there is another stanza from the same poem which says that, if they have the
14:23
ability to talk to the crowds yet keep your virtue, walk with Kings – nor lose the common
14:27
touch, if neither good friends nor foes can hurt you, yet all men count with you but none
14:32
too much — if only the politicians understood the gist of that line, we would have a progressive
14:36
country by 2030 where we’ll all be proud of not just the way the country is running
14:41
but also proud about our politicians.
14:44
And finally, you know, I’m an actor and the dream that I have for myself is that in
14:53
2030 I’m as relevant and as handsome hopefully but if age was to catch up, then they probably
14:59
would have mapped my face by then and use technology to make me look as young or old,
15:04
as the role desired me to look, and I’m still able to romance the pretty young things
15:07
that would be part of the industry in 2030.
15:14
I see that’s got many guys going ham.
15:17
And finally as an actor, I’m used and prone to dialogues, I love to speak dialogues, and
15:23
I recently found a line that blew me apart and I thought it was a phenomenal Hindi film
15:29
dialogue, where this great gentleman has said, “That whatever I am today and all the achievements
15:35
that have been – that has been possible by me and what will eventually also be possible
15:40
by me in the near future are all because of my angel mother.”
15:44
Do you know who said that?
15:47
You know who said that?
15:50
Shockingly Abraham Lincoln!
15:53
So I dream of a 2030 where every Indian says the exact same thing about his mother and
16:01
not just about his mother but also about his motherland – and also for the sake of posterity
16:10
about his mother-in-law.
16:13
But hey, ladies and gentlemen, what do I know?
16:15
I am an actor.
16:16
Thank you very much for your patient hearing.
